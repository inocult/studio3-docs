# Core Concepts

Understanding Studio3's core concepts is essential for participating effectively in the ecosystem. This guide breaks down the fundamental mechanics that power our venture building platform.

## 🎯 The Arena System

<div class="arena-card">
<h3>Public Performance Spaces</h3>

Arenas are where ventures live and breathe. Think of them as transparent stages where:

- 📋 **Milestones** are declared publicly
- 📊 **Progress** is tracked in real-time
- 🗣️ **Community** provides feedback
- ✅ **Validation** happens openly
- 🏆 **Rewards** are distributed fairly

Every action in an Arena is recorded on-chain, creating an immutable history of each venture's journey.
</div>

### How Arenas Work

1. **Ventures Enter**: Founders bring their Spark NFTs into specific Arenas
2. **Milestones Declared**: Clear, measurable goals are set with deadlines
3. **Signals Flow**: Community members express belief or doubt
4. **Work Happens**: Founders execute in public view
5. **Validation Occurs**: Anchors verify completion
6. **Consequences Apply**: Success brings rewards, failure burns tokens

## 📡 The $SIGNAL Token

<div class="grid">
<div class="arena-card">
<h3>🟢 Belief Signals</h3>

Express conviction that a venture will achieve its milestones:
- Early signals earn higher multipliers
- Correct predictions grow your holdings
- Wrong predictions burn tokens
</div>

<div class="arena-card">
<h3>🔴 Doubt Signals</h3>

Express skepticism about execution ability:
- Helps ventures identify weaknesses
- Rewards contrarian accuracy
- Creates balanced feedback loops
</div>
</div>

### Signal Mechanics

!!! warning "Not Financial Speculation"
    $SIGNAL tokens represent **conviction about execution**, not financial bets. They're utility tokens that power the belief mechanics of Studio3, not securities or gambling instruments.

**Key Properties:**
- **Earned**: Through accurate predictions and participation
- **Burned**: When predictions prove wrong
- **Non-tradeable**: During active signal periods
- **Reputation-linked**: Your signal history affects your multipliers

## 🎨 The Three-NFT System

Every Studio3 venture is defined by three interconnected NFTs:

### 1. Spark NFT 🎨

<div class="arena-card">
The **genesis** of every venture:

- Created from remixed IP-NFTs via the Flambette marketplace
- Contains the core idea and initial parameters
- Tradeable until claimed by a founder
- Burns upon successful Forge completion
- Required to enter any Arena
</div>

### 2. Signal NFT 📡

<div class="arena-card">
The **living identity** of the venture:

- Minted when a founder wins their Forge Duel
- Dynamically updates with each phase progression
- Displays current metrics, phase, and achievements
- Controls access to venture resources
- Cannot be transferred until Ascension
</div>

### 3. Halo NFT 🛡️

<div class="arena-card">
The **mark of sovereignty**:

- Created during Container DAO formation
- Held in the Genesis Wallet (multisig)
- Soulbound - can never be transferred
- Only unlocks upon successful graduation
- Represents true venture independence
</div>

## 🏗️ Container DAO Architecture

<div class="arena-card">
<h3>Lightweight Governance Wrapper</h3>

Container DAOs are minimal governance structures that:

- 🏦 **Hold** all venture NFTs in a Genesis Wallet
- 🗳️ **Enable** community participation without equity
- 📊 **Track** venture metrics and milestones
- 🔐 **Secure** assets through multisig control
- 🚀 **Facilitate** progressive decentralization

They're not traditional DAOs - they're purpose-built containers for venture development.
</div>

### Genesis Wallet Structure

The Genesis Wallet is a multisig that:
- Requires 2-of-3 signatures initially
- Holds Spark, Signal, and Halo NFTs
- Controls venture treasury
- Manages milestone payouts
- Enables emergency interventions

## 🌊 Seven-Phase Lifecycle

Each venture progresses through seven distinct phases:

<div class="phase-timeline">
<div class="phase-indicator phase-spark">✨ Spark</div>
<div class="phase-indicator phase-forge">⚔️ Forge</div>
<div class="phase-indicator phase-ignition">🚀 Ignition</div>
<div class="phase-indicator phase-drift">🌊 Drift</div>
<div class="phase-indicator phase-orbit">🛸 Orbit</div>
<div class="phase-indicator phase-flare">🔥 Flare</div>
<div class="phase-indicator phase-ascension">🎖️ Ascension</div>
</div>

### Phase Progression Rules

1. **Sequential**: Must complete phases in order
2. **Gated**: Each phase has specific entry requirements
3. **Time-bound**: Phases have maximum durations
4. **Milestone-driven**: Progress requires achievement
5. **Community-validated**: Anchors must approve transitions
