# How It Works

## The Studio3 Process in Simple Steps

<div class="arena-card" markdown="1">

### 🎯 The Core Loop

1. **Founders declare** what they'll build
2. **Community signals** belief or doubt with tokens
3. **Work happens** in public view
4. **Progress is validated** by experts
5. **Rewards flow** to those who predicted correctly

</div>

## 🚀 Step-by-Step Journey

### Step 1: Ideas Enter the Arena

<div class="arena-card" markdown="1">

### ✨ The Spark Phase

- Entrepreneurs create **Spark NFTs** from existing research/IP
- Ideas are presented in public **Arenas**
- Community members browse and evaluate
- Initial interest gathering begins
- Best ideas attract early believers

</div>

### Step 2: Founders Compete

<div class="arena-card" markdown="1">

### ⚔️ The Forge Duel

- Multiple founders can compete for the same idea
- They enter a **public competition** (The Forge)
- Each presents their vision and capabilities
- Community votes determine the winner
- Winner gets exclusive rights to build

</div>

### Step 3: Building Begins

<div class="arena-card" markdown="1">

### 🏗️ Public Development

The winning founder:

- Forms a **Container DAO** (lightweight governance structure)
- Declares specific **milestones** with deadlines
- Works transparently with daily updates
- Engages with community feedback
- Builds toward declared goals

</div>

### Step 4: Community Participation

<div class="arena-card" markdown="1">

### 📡 Signaling Mechanics

**How the community participates:**

1. **Research** the venture and team
2. **Decide** to signal belief or doubt
3. **Stake** $SIGNAL tokens on outcome
4. **Monitor** progress actively
5. **Earn or lose** based on results

**Example:**

- You believe TeamX will deliver their app by March 1st
- You stake 1,000 $SIGNAL tokens as a belief signal
- If they succeed: You get 1,500-3,000 tokens back (1.5x-3x)
- If they fail: Your 1,000 tokens are burned forever

</div>

### Step 5: Validation Process

<div class="arena-card" markdown="1">

### ⚓ Quality Assurance

When milestones are complete:

- Founder submits **evidence** of completion
- **Anchors** (validators) review thoroughly
- They verify claims are accurate
- Decision is made: Success or Failure
- Results trigger automatic settlements

</div>

### Step 6: Rewards & Consequences

<div class="arena-card" markdown="1">

### 💰 The Settlement

**If Milestone Succeeds:**

- Believers earn token multipliers (1.5x-3x)
- Doubters lose their entire stake
- Founder unlocks next funding
- Anchor earns validation fee

**If Milestone Fails:**

- Doubters earn token multipliers (1.2x-2x)
- Believers lose their entire stake
- Founder faces reputation damage
- Must pivot or abandon

</div>

## 🎮 The Seven Phase Journey

Every venture progresses through seven phases:

<div class="grid">
<div class="arena-card" markdown="1">

#### Phase 1-3: Foundation

1. **Spark** ✨ - Idea validation
2. **Forge** ⚔️ - Founder selection
3. **Ignition** 🚀 - MVP building

</div>

<div class="arena-card" markdown="1">

#### Phase 4-6: Growth

4. **Drift** 🌊 - Finding product-market fit
5. **Orbit** 🛸 - Stable operations
6. **Flare** 🔥 - Scaling up

</div>

<div class="arena-card" markdown="1">

#### Phase 7: Graduation

7. **Ascension** 🎖️ - Full independence

</div>
</div>

## 🔄 The Ecosystem Cycle

<div class="arena-card" markdown="1">

### How Value Flows

1. **Supporters provide capital** through signals
2. **Founders use capital** to build ventures
3. **Successful ventures** create value
4. **Value returns** to correct predictors
5. **Failed ventures** burn incorrect stakes
6. **System improves** through natural selection

</div>
