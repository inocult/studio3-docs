## Understanding Echo Networks

### What Are Echo Networks?

<div class="arena-card" markdown="1">

<h3>🔗 Network Fundamentals</h3>

**Definition:**
Echo Networks are organized groups of Echoes who collaborate to:
- Share research and insights
- Pool resources and capital
- Coordinate signal strategies
- Amplify collective impact
- Achieve superior returns

**Network Types:**
1. **Research Collectives** - Deep analysis focus
**2. **Signal Syndicates** - Coordinated investments
**3. **Sector Specialists** - Domain expertise
**4. **Regional Groups** - Geographic focus
**5. **Strategy Circles** - Method alignment
**Key Principle:**
The whole becomes greater than the sum of its parts

### Network Theory

<div class="arena-card" markdown="1">

<h3>📐 Network Dynamics</h3>

**Metcalfe's Law Applied:**
Network Value = n² (where n = active members)

**Network Effects:**
