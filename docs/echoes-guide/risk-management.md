## Risk Management Fundamentals

### Understanding Echo Risks

<div class="arena-card" markdown="1">

<h3>‚ö†Ô∏è The Risk Landscape</h3>

**Unique Signal Risks:**
1. **Binary Outcomes** - 100% loss possible
**2. **No Stop Losses** - Can't exit mid-signal
**3. **Time Decay** - Locked until milestone
**4. **Liquidity Risk** - Capital tied up
**5. **Correlation Risk** - Ventures may be connected
**Systemic Risks:**
- Market-wide downturns
- Platform risks
- Regulatory changes
- Technology failures
- Black swan events

**Behavioral Risks:**
- Overconfidence
- Revenge trading
- FOMO decisions
- Analysis paralysis
- Emotional trading

</div>

### Risk vs Reward Framework

<div class="arena-card" markdown="1">

<h3>‚öñÔ∏è The Risk Equation</h3>

**Expected Value Calculation:**
```
EV = (P(Win) √ó Reward) - (P(Loss) √ó Stake)

Example:
70% win rate, 2x multiplier
EV = (0.7 √ó 2) - (0.3 √ó 1) = 1.4 - 0.3 = 1.1
10% positive expected value
```

**Risk-Adjusted Returns:**
```
Sharpe = (Return - Risk-Free Rate) / Volatility
Target Sharpe > 1.0 for good risk-adjusted returns
```

**Practical Application:**
Only take risks with positive expected value

</div>

## Core Risk Rules

### The Foundation Rules

<div class="arena-card" markdown="1">

<h3>üìã Non-Negotiable Risk Rules</h3>

**Rule 1: The 2% Rule**
Never risk more than 2% of total capital on single signal

**Rule 2: The 10% Rule**
Never have more than 10% at risk at any time

**Rule 3: The Correlation Rule**
Never have >20% in correlated positions

**Rule 4: The Phase Rule**
Never have >40% in any single phase

**Rule 5: The Recovery Rule**
After 20% drawdown, reduce all positions by 50%

**Breaking these rules = Path to ruin**

</div>

### Position Sizing Science

<div class="arena-card" markdown="1">

<h3>üìè Mathematical Position Sizing</h3>

**Kelly Criterion (Full):**
```
f = (p √ó b - q) / b

Where:
f = fraction of capital to bet
p = probability of win
b = net odds received on win
q = probability of loss (1-p)
```

**Kelly for Signals (Conservative):**
```
Signal Size = Kelly √ó 0.25 √ó Bankroll

Why 0.25?
- Reduces volatility
- Accounts for estimation error
- Prevents ruin
- Smoother growth
```

**Practical Sizing Table:**
| Confidence | Win Rate | Multiplier | Max Size |
|------------|----------|------------|----------|
| Very High | 80% | 2x | 5% |
| High | 70% | 2x | 3% |
| Medium | 60% | 2x | 2% |
| Low | 50% | 2x | 1% |

</div>

## Risk Assessment Tools

‚ñ° Exit plan considered?
‚ñ° Portfolio impact assessed?
‚ñ° Black swan considered?

## Advanced Risk Techniques

### Value at Risk (VaR)

<div class="arena-card" markdown="1">

<h3>üìà Statistical Risk Measurement</h3>

**VaR Calculation:**
"Maximum expected loss at 95% confidence level"

**Example:**
- Portfolio: 10,000 $SIGNAL
- Daily volatility: 5%
- 95% VaR: 1.65 √ó 5% √ó 10,000 = 825 $SIGNAL

**Interpretation:**
95% of days, won't lose more than 825 $SIGNAL

**CVaR (Conditional VaR):**
Expected loss in worst 5% of cases
Typically 1.5-2x VaR

</div>

### Risk Parity Approach

<div class="arena-card" markdown="1">

<h3>‚öñÔ∏è Equal Risk Contribution</h3>

**Concept:**
Each position contributes equally to portfolio risk

**Implementation:**
1. Calculate each position's risk
2. Adjust sizes inversely to risk
3. High risk = smaller position
4. Low risk = larger position

**Example:**
- Spark signal: 1% position (high risk)
- Orbit signal: 4% position (low risk)
- Equal risk contribution

</div>
