# Rewards & Penalties

## The Economics of Execution

Studio3's rewards and penalties system creates powerful incentives for quality execution while fairly distributing value among all participants. This balanced approach ensures sustainable ecosystem growth.

## System Overview

### The Balance of Consequences

### ‚öñÔ∏è Rewards vs Penalties

**Core Philosophy:**

- üèÜ **Rewards** incentivize positive behavior
- üî• **Penalties** discourage negative behavior
- ‚öñÔ∏è **Balance** creates sustainable ecosystem
- üéØ **Fairness** ensures long-term participation

**Key Principles:**

1. Rewards proportional to risk taken
2. Penalties severe enough to deter gaming
3. Transparent calculation methods
4. Immediate settlement when possible
5. No retroactive changes
