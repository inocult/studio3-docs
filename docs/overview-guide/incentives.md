# Aligned Incentives

## Where Everyone Wins Together

Studio3's revolutionary design aligns the interests of all participants, creating a positive-sum ecosystem where individual success drives collective prosperity. This alignment is the secret sauce that makes the platform work.

## The Alignment Philosophy

### Breaking Traditional Misalignment

### 🔗 Traditional vs Studio3 Model

**Traditional Venture Ecosystem:**

- **VCs want huge returns, founders want control**
- Investors seek quick exits, builders need time
- Advisors give minimal time for maximum equity
- Community gets nothing despite creating value

** Studio3 Alignment:**

- **Everyone profits from venture success**
- Transparent milestones align timelines
- Active participation rewarded fairly
- Community captures value they create
