# Ecosystem Overview

## The Studio3 Universe

Studio3 exists at the center of a revolutionary ecosystem designed to transform how ventures are built, supported, and grown. Understanding this ecosystem is crucial to maximizing your success on the platform.

## Core Components

### üèüÔ∏è The Arena System

At the heart of Studio3 lies the Arena - public spaces where ventures prove themselves through transparent execution and community validation.

    - **Spark Arenas**: Where ideas compete for attention**
    - **Forge Arenas**: Battlegrounds for founder duels**

### üì° The Signal Economy

The $SIGNAL token creates a unique economy of belief:
