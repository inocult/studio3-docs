## Understanding Red Flags

### What Are Red Flags?

<div class="arena-card" markdown="1">

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Defining Warning Signs

**Red Flag Characteristics:**

- ** Early indicators of problems
- Patterns that predict failure
- Behaviors that concern
- Metrics that alarm
- Situations requiring attention
** Red Flag Categories:
- 
1. **Critical**
- Immediate action needed
2. **Serious**
- Close monitoring required
3. **Concerning**
- Investigation warranted
4. **Minor**
- Note and track
5. **Potential**
- Keep awareness**
- ** Why Red Flags Matter:
- ** Enable early intervention
- Prevent major failures
- Protect stakeholders
- Guide founder attention
- Maintain standards

### The Cost of Ignoring Red Flags

<div class="arena-card" markdown="1">

### üí∏ Consequences of Inaction
** Escalation Timeline:
```
Warning Sign ‚Üí Minor Issue ‚Üí Major Problem ‚Üí Crisis ‚Üí Failure
  (Day 1)      (Week 1)      (Month 1)      (Month 3)  (Month 6)
  
Cost to Fix:    $           $$            $$$         $$$$      Total Loss
Difficulty:      Easy        Moderate      Hard        Critical   Impossible

!!! warning "Early Detection Saves Ventures"
    The earlier you spot red flags, the easier they are to address. Develop your pattern recognition skills and trust your instincts - they're often right.

!!! tip "Balance in Detection"
    Be vigilant but not paranoid. Every venture has issues; your job is to identify which ones matter and help address them constructively.
