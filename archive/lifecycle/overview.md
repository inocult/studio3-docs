# The 7-Phase Company Lifecycle

Every venture in Studio3 follows a carefully designed seven-phase journey from initial idea to complete sovereignty. This lifecycle provides structure while allowing flexibility for different venture types and market conditions.

## 🎯 Lifecycle Philosophy

<div class="arena-card" markdown="1">
<h3>Progressive Validation Model</h3>

The seven phases aren't arbitrary - they map to the natural evolution of ventures:

- **Early phases** focus on idea validation and founder selection
- **Middle phases** emphasize product development and market fit
- **Later phases** enable scaling and eventual independence
- **Each phase** has specific goals, metrics, and support systems
- **Progression** requires meeting objective criteria

This structure provides clarity for founders and confidence for supporters.

### Regression Scenarios

Ventures can move backward under certain conditions:

- **Orbit → Drift**: Lost product-market fit
- **Drift → Spark**: Failed pivot attempts
- **Ignition → Spark**: Team dissolution
- **Any → Dissolution**: Catastrophic failure

!!! warning "Phase Regression"
    Moving backward isn't failure - it's recognition that more work is needed. Many successful ventures experience regression before ultimately succeeding.
