</div>

<div class="arena-card" markdown="1">

### Handling Doubt Signals

Doubt signals are valuable feedback:

**Constructive Response Framework**:
1. **Acknowledge**: Thank doubters for engagement
2. **Understand**: Dig into specific concerns
3. **Address**: Provide data or adjust approach
4. **Follow-up**: Show how feedback was incorporated
5. **Convert**: Turn doubters into believers

!!! tip "Doubt as Data"
    High-quality doubt signals often identify real weaknesses. Ventures that successfully address doubt tend to be stronger in later phases.

## 🔄 Iteration During Spark

### Pivot Triggers

Consider pivoting when:
- Belief signals plateau below threshold
- Consistent doubt on core premise
- Better opportunity discovered

- Market shift detected

### Pivot Types

<div class="arena-card" markdown="1">
<h3>🔄 Common Spark Pivots</h3>

3. **Solution Pivot**: Same problem, different approach
4. **Technology Pivot**: Different IP combination
5. **Business Model Pivot**: Different monetization

Each pivot resets some momentum but can unlock new belief.
