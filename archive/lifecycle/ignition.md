!!! warning "Milestone Best Practices"
    - Make them specific and measurable
    - Set realistic timeframes
    - Include clear success criteria
    - Build in buffer time
    - Communicate progress regularly

## Phase Mechanics

### Signal Dynamics

During Ignition, signal mechanics intensify:

- **Higher Stakes** - Failed milestones burn more tokens
- **Belief Multipliers** - Early supporters earn 2-3x
- **Doubt Value** - Constructive criticism helps iteration
- **Anchor Weight** - Validator opinions matter more

### Resource Allocation

<h3>Treasury Management</h3>

Your Container DAO treasury must balance:

- Development costs
- Marketing expenses
- Community rewards
- Emergency reserves
- Future phase needs

## Success Metrics

Track these KPIs during Ignition:

1. **Development Velocity** - Features shipped per week
2. **Community Growth** - Active participants
3. **Signal Ratio** - Belief vs doubt trends
4. **Milestone Completion** - On-time delivery rate
5. **User Feedback** - Early adopter satisfaction

## Common Challenges
